**Version 2.4**

Welcome to the full test template for the github md import feature of AEM. This document covers all the styles availalbe and how to implement.
Note: when loading github url into your page, it may take a number of tries to get the content to refresh. I am working with IT to resolve the bug. If you have just done an update in GitHub, it's best to wait for a few minutes to make sure you sync the latest version.

## Headers (H2)
Make sure you don't use the single # for any headers. Only the title of your article should be an H1. This isn't just a visual thing, this will impact your SEO score in google.
Always start with the ##.

### Sub header level 3 (H3)
#### Sub header level 4 (H4)
##### Sub header Level 5 (rarely used)

## General text styling
```markdown
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
```

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

Superscript and Subscript doesn't seem to work at the moment.
```markdown
Superscript
H~2~O

Subscript
X^2^
```

Superscript example: H~2~O

Subscript example: X^2^

### Special Characters
The following are special characters in markdown. When used in a sentence, they transfer to AEM just fine. If you're having issues with any of these characters, try preceeding them with a backslash.

- \\ backslash itself
- \` backtick
- \* asterisk
- \_ underscore
- \{ \} curly braces
- \[ \] square brackets
- \( \) parentheses
- \# hash mark
- \+ plus sign
- \- minus sign (hyphen)
- \. dot
- \! exclamation mark

```

### Links
```markdown
[Intel](https://www.intel.com).
```
Example:
My favorite company is [Intel](https://www.intel.com).

mailto:
(note for spam reasons, we discourage use of email links)
[example@gitlab.com](mailto:example@gitlab.com)

Anchor Links: link to another part of the same article [Table of Contents](#tableofcontents).
Note: AEM wants the links to have no dashes in them. GitHub standard is to have dashes between multiple words, ex: `[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)`

```
[Table of Contents](#tableofcontents)
```

<br><br>

### Block quotes
This doesn't work with our template. We have requested some code updates so that block quotes actually render properly on articles. I will update this file once that is done.

```markdown
> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
```

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

<br><br>
***
### CSS Attribution - Requested

Another Item we are exploring is the ability to call the css that is used on the site. This isn't working yet. I will update once we have the functionality in place. There are two options IT is exploring. 
We have requested that IT add this feature so we can call certain css properties into markdown. 

{:.greyHighlight} 
As of 5/20/22, IT says this feature will come in the next few releases.

### Footnotes 
Footnotes aren't working as expected. I have raised a ticket with IT to see if they can enable this feature.
```markdown
Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]  
  
[^1]: This is the footnote.
```
Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^2]  
  
[^2]: This is another footnote to go with the first.


New footnotes <sup id="a1">[1](#c2)</sup>

<b id="c2">1</b>Then from within footnote, link back to it

Why do I need this line? Test footnote content here.(#a1)


```markdown
New footnotes <sup id="a1">[1](#c2)</sup>

<b id="c2">1</b>Then from within footnote, link back to it

Why do I need this line? Test footnote content here.(#a1)
```

**Another Footnote Way**

Here's a sentence with a footnote1. <sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup>
Here's a sentence with a footnote2. <sup id="a2">[[2]](#f2)</sup>

<sup id="f1">[[1]](#a1)</sup> This is the footnote1.
<sup id="f2">[[2]](#a2)</sup> This is another footnote to go with the first.

```
Here's a sentence with a footnote1. <sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup>
Here's a sentence with a footnote2. <sup id="a2">[[2]](#f2)</sup>

<sup id="f1">[[1]](#a1)</sup> This is the footnote1.
<sup id="f2">[[2]](#a2)</sup> This is another footnote to go with the first.
```

## Examples of math in .md

This expression $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ is inlined but doesn't work at the moment.

When this is a full expression, it works fine.
$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$


<br><br>
***
## Code on your page
Adding code into your sentence is simple. 
```markdown
`this is your code`
```

Example
Some `inline code` if you need to put inside a sentence.


If you have javascript:
```javascript
// An highlighted block
var foo = 'bar';
```

A very common one on the DevZone is bash
```bash
export I_MPI_ROOT=/opt/intel/oneapi/lib/intel64
export PATH=${I_MPI_ROOT}/libfabric/bin:${I_MPI_ROOT}/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${I_MPI_ROOT}/libfabric:${I_MPI_ROOT}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export FI_PROVIDER_PATH=${I_MPI_ROOT}/libfabric
```

## Lists
### Creating an ordered list
1. First item  
2. Second item  
3. Third item  
4. Fourth item

This will also do the same thing
1. First item  
1. Second item  
1. Third item  
1. Fourth item

This will also do the same thing
1. First item  
8. Second item  
3. Third item  
5. Fourth item

Most of the time a MD editor will try to fix your list numbering
You can also indent by adding a few spaces.

### Creating Unordered Lists
- First item  
- Second item  
- Third item  
- Fourth item

**Split Lists**
- list one - item 1
- list one - item 2
     - sub item 1
     - sub item 2
- list one - item 3
<br><br>
- list two - item A
- list two - item B

## Tables

```markdown

| Header | Title |  
| Paragraph | Text |
```

## A collapsible section with markdown
This does work within the article template. THe arrow is a bit large, but I will see if there is a way to get it updated.
Code:
```markdown
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  <br>
  1. A numbered
  2. list
     * With some
     * Sub bullets
</details>
```

  2. list
     * With some
     * Sub bullets
</details>

## Images

To include an image from intel.com, you can do a relative link. Make sure you put all stock imagery, marketing imagery, logos, and photos of people in intel.com where we monitor licensing and expiry dates. You can use the relative path to your image.

```markdown
![This is your Alt Text](/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/images/oneapi-kits20211-4x3-rwd.png)
```

![This is your Alt Text](/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/images/oneapi-kits20211-4x3-rwd.png)

<br>
You can also choose to host your screenshots, diagrams, terminal window images in your repo. Just remember, you are now supporting the live site. Don't move or delete images without updating your article. Also, make sure to use the full github URL and not a relative path.

## Videos
Go to the youtube video and copy the embed code. Just replace the iframe src url with your youtube video URL.

```markdown
<div>
  <div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7st0drv54U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen
      style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe>
  </div>

You can also use this embed code for brightcove videos. Just replace the videoid= # in the embed code below
To find the video ID, simply right click on the video on developer.intel.com and select **Player Information**. Video ID value is listed under Source.

```markdown
<div style="position: relative; display: block; max-width: 900px;">
    <div style="padding-top: 56.25%;">
      <iframe src="https://players.brightcove.net/740838651001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6286027295001" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe>

## FAQ:

__Q: My .raw file isn't updating, thus AEM isn't pulling my most recent content.__

A: Note, AEM pulls from github's raw file. The raw file is cached and only updaed every 3 minutes. Check if the .raw file shows the updates you're expecting. 

__Q: AEM isn't pulling any content and not giving any errors.__

A: Try adding some text in the body of AEM, then having AEM pull your content from GitHub. There's an open ticket for this now with IT. It should be resolved though (as of 5/12/22)

A: Watchout for special characters. Not just the ones listed in the [special character section](#special-characters), but also, single and double quotes. GitHub is leniant about styled quotes like: `‚ÄúHello‚Äù`, AEM will not accept those unless they're in a code block or snippet. They must be straight double quotes: `"` . Similarly, single quotes `‚Äòthank you‚Äô` must use staight single quote: `'`.
